<h3>A Chance For Everyone To Ride A Bike!!</h3>

<p>West Euston Ability Bikes began in 2011 with a base in Queen Mary’s Yard, Inner Circle, Regent’s Park, NW1 4NR and its short life has seen hundreds of participants.</p>
<p>West Euston Partnership’s Aiming High grant from Camden Council enabled the charity to buy 9 specially built bikes suitable to be enjoyed by people with disabilities and their carers.</p>
<p>The bikes are well used by organisations including Swiss Cottage School, The Bridge School, The Pirate Castle, Elfrida Rathbone and Camden Sports Development Team.</p>
