		<h2>About WEP</h2>
<p>West Euston Partnership is an alliance of community, private, statutory and voluntary sectors with a successful record since 1992 of working to improve services for the community.</p>
<p>WEP was set up by local people in 1992 to help make the area a better place to live and work. Local people were concerned about street fighting, racial tension and lack of facilities or opportunities. Community safety and the need for facilities for young people, central to the welfare of all local people, brought local stakeholders together. Over the years WEP has led in bringing considerable investment into West Euston.</p>
<p>WEP registered as a charity in 2008 and continues to help make change happen by listening to local people and working with them to influence decision makers.</p>
